#Open River Map

## What it is about
Open River Map is a pathos name for simple tool that allows to calculate distance on river. I have faced problem with planning multidays kayak trips in areas without well developed travelers infrastructure. Of course thread and paper map can do the job but it is XXI century already for a while. So here it is.

## Status
More or less working prototype without live deployments yet.. 

## Plans
1. Limit length to user selected points.
1. Make map responsive.
